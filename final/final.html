	<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
	<p>     Hello my name is Trevor Simonson and I am a game design
	major at George Mason University. I have been a fan of games 
	ever since I was a little kid and my parents bought me a
	Playstation 2. I have many fond memories of playing games
	with friends and I strive to one day make games that can have
	the same effect on other people.</P>

	<p>I am very detail oriented and always give my work 100%. I am a
	great team player who always strives for excellece.</p>
