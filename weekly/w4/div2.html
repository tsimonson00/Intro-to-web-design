		<h2>Users often perceive aesthetically<br> pleasing design as design that's <br> more usable.<h2>

		<h3>Aesthetically pleasing design can make users more<br>
		tolerant of minor usability issues.</h3>
		<h3>Aesthetically pleasing design can mask usability problems<br> and prevent issues from being discovered during usability<br> testing.</h3>

		<h4>-ORIGINS</h4>
		<p>The aesthetic usability effect was first studied in the field of<br>
		human-computer interaction in 1995. Reasearchers Masaaki<br>
		Kurosu and Kaori Kashimura from the Hitachi Design Center<br>
		tested 26 variations of an ATM UI, asking the 252 study<br>
		participants to rate each design on ease of use, as well as<br>
		aestetic appeal. They found a stronger correlation between the<br>
		participants' rathings of aesthetic appeal and perceived ease of use<br>
		than the correlation between their ratings of aesthetic appeal and<br>
		actual ease of use. Kurosu and Kashimura conclueded that users<br>
		are strongly influenced by the aesthetics of any given interface,<br>
		even when they try to evaluate the underlying functionality of the<br>
		system.</p>
