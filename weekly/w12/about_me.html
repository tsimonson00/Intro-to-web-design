				<h1>Nice meeting you</h1>
				<p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. 
I like to read, I like to write; 
I like to think, I like to dream; 
I like to talk, I like to listen.</p> 

<p>I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; 
I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.</p> 

<p>I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.</p> 

<p>I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter.</p> 

<p>like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
