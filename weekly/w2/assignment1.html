<h1>Website Critique</h1>
	<h2>The Good</h2>
	<img src= "img/youtube.png" alt= "Screenshot of youtube home page">
<p><a href="Youtube.com"</p> youtube.com </a>

	<p>Youtube is a website that millions of people use every day and happens to also be backed by one of the largest corporations in the world. The design, at least to me, feels very sleek and user friendly while still being easy to use. All the videos on the homepage all fit into neat rows that are consistent throughout. The ability to hide the sidebar makes it so that the page is never too cluttered with too much information at all times while still having the functionality when needed. When watching a video the site gives the user a lot of customization options to make sure it's always optimal for the user. The design feels very modern and cutting edge without feeling like the user experience is compromised for the sake of aesthetics.</p>
	<img src= "img/amazon.png" alt= "Screenshot of amazon page" width= "50%">
	<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com"</p>amazon.com </a>
	<p>The background on amazon is much better than the last site and the site is broken down into distinct columns. The images on products are well laid out and have clear boundaries to make it easier to disguise on product from another. One thing I don't like about the site though is a lot of the things in the account settings are just big boxes of hyperlinks and it can make it very daunting to navigate when you are looking for something in specific. The site does a good job at showing info that the user would want to see while keeping unnecessary info tucked away and hidden until the user asks to see it, like your cart or account info.</p>
	<h3> The Bad</h3>
	<img scr= "img/blinkee.png" alt= "screeshot of blinkee site" width= "50%">
	<p><a href ="https://blinkee.com"</p> blinkee.com </a>
	<p>Blinkee is a site that equally feels like it was made yesterday and 15 years ago at the same time. The header image is extremely stretched and low resolution, but the different headers you can choose look rather up to date. The images for the products are all on the same page with no clear boundaries between them. The aesthetics of the page are so conflicting and it feels very disjointed. Lastly, the font on the main body of the page is very small and light making it harder to read than it should be in my opinion.</p>
	<img scr= "img/greatdreams.png" alt=" greatdreams site" width="50%">
	<p><a href="http://www.greatdreams.com"</p> greatdreams.com </a>
	<p>The first thing that pops out is the color scheme, it's so… tacky. The two colors don’t match and there is no reason to use such bright colors for the background, as it makes the text harder to read too. Next, the pictures and the text are all in the same column. Also, a lot of the text is the same boring default font which doesn’t make the website very appealing to look at or read, and a lot of the text is made red or blue and on top of the background color it can be fairly hard to read easily. The website has no structure and just looks like a big text wall with a few pictures thrown in, and it looks like something made in the late 90s when the internet was just getting big.</p>
